        This involves several possible transformations:

        1. Generalized loop-invariant code motion

        3. Expansion of constants over loop-dependent terms

        :param mode: Any value in (0, 1, 2, 3). Each ``mode`` corresponds to a
            different expression rewriting strategy. A strategy impacts the aspects:
            amount of floating point calculations required to evaluate the expression;
            amount of temporary storage introduced; accuracy of the result.

            * mode == 0: No rewriting is performed
            * mode == 1: Apply one pass: generalized loop-invariant code motion.
                Safest: accuracy not affected
            * mode == 2: Apply four passes: generalized loop-invariant code motion;
                expansion of inner-loop dependent expressions; factorization of
                inner-loop dependent terms; generalized loop-invariant code motion.
                Barely affects accuracy, improves performance while trying to
                minimize temporary storage
            * mode == 3: Apply four passes: generalized loop-invariant code motion
                of outer-loop dependent expressions; expansion of inner-loop dependent
                expressions; factorization of inner-loop dependent terms; 'aggressive'
                generalized loop-invariant code motion (in which n-rank temporary
                arrays can be allocated to keep expressions independent of more than
                one loop). Due to hoisting less expressions, factorization can be
                more aggressive, so accuracy can be more affected than in modes 0, 1,
                and 2. This ``mode`` is ideal if one wants to precompute as much
                expressions as possible outside the whole loop nest. Therefore, it is
                recommended to execute a ``precompute`` pass after ``rewrite(mode=3)``.
                This aggressively reduces flops, but also increases temporary storage
